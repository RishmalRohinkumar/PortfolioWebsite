# Rishmal Rohin Kumar's Portfolio Website

Hi there! My name is Rishmal Rohin Kumar and I am a third-year Computer Science major at University of California, San Diego with a focus on Software Engineering. Since I first started learning computer science about 5 years ago, I have learned a lot of object-oriented programming languages, such as Java, Python, and C++, and I have recently started learning more Front-End Web Development, with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I enjoy both front-end and back-end, but I am partial to back-end and Software Engineering because I love creating large projects using complex algorithms, and I think the Software Engineering approach to that task is one that I could definitely see myself doing as a career.  
For this website, I did my best to practice semantic HTML to ensure that my code had meaning, rather than being strictly visual. Additionally, I tried to solidify my fundamentals in CSS and JavaScript, so that I well set up to learn the advanced concepts, particularly modern JavaScript frameworks.  
I am currently looking for Software Engineering or Front-End Web Development internships for Summer 2022. Please feel free to contact me regarding internships at my email, rishmal.rohinkumar@gmail.com, or my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rishmal-rohin-kumar/)!
